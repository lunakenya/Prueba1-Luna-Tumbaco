# Real-Time Chat with Service Queue Simulation

This project is a simple real-time chat application developed using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**. The server simulates a message processing queue where messages sent by the user receive an automated response after a short processing delay.

## 📋 **Features**
1. **Real-Time Chat**: Users can send messages and receive automatic simulated responses from a "bot."
2. **Service Queue Simulation**: Messages are processed with a slight delay to simulate a processing queue.
3. **Simple Frontend**: Basic HTML interface with messages differentiated between the user and the bot.
